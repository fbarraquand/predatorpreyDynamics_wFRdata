# predatorpreyDynamics_wFRdata
Fits dynamic predator-prey models with (and without) auxillary functional response (FR) data

* ``bayesian`` fits predator-prey models using JAGS (largely discrete-time Leslie-May models). With FR data and without FR data. 
* ``frequentist`` attempts maximum likelihood on the same models. RMA denote the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. 
* ``simulations`` contains specific simulations of mechanistic models (including some a little more complex than the fitted models)
* ``reports`` contain the progress report. The ``CHANGELOG.md`` file tracks important changes to the code, chronologically. 

* ``figures_article`` tracks up to date file that served to produce the figures of the corresponding article
