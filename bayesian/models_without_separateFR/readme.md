## Things to investigate to explain (very) poor performance of the model without explicit FR data

* Environmental noise level (perhaps much better at low noise levels) -> NO
* Gamma priors on the functional response parameters -- would say, lognormal change results? ->  Not really
* Time series - is 100 in fact too low? -> in this case most TS are too low.
