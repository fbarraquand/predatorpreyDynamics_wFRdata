The preliminary conclusions from that analysis of the noisy LC dataset are that:
* the model is identifiable from time-series data only for 100 timestep
* however, functional response parameters (and other parameters) are more precise with the added FR data
* thus, even there is a gain to combine with the FR data (although it is no necessity). 

It is quite probable though that as the noise on the functional response increases (e.g. to sigma = 0.5), the identifiability without the FR data decreases.
